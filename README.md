# RATS
(Reverse) . Applicant . Tracking . Systems

## Introduction
Recruiters use Applicant tracking systems, to filter their applicants before even looking.
What if I had the capacity to see what they see? To predict what they predict? To make it a bit more of an even playing field.
Armed with data, only then can you make decissions that pierce through the fog of the future and make projects with technologies that are rising in demand.
