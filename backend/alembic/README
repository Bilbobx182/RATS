# Alembic

Alembic is a DB Migration tool. Think of it as git for DB changes if you've never been around anything like it.

This way it will be easy to init then migrate for others to reproduce.


## Commands

- `alembic revision -m "Message here"` Creates a new revision.
- `alembic upgrade head` to apply the changes.
